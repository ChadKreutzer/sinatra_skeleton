# Simple Sinatra Skeleton

This is my default Sinatra setup with Bootstrap, jQuery and Font Awesome all
good to go.

As I learn more, I may make changes and improvements to it. There is a little
sample page and styling setup, but you can just remove that and put in your
own. If you notice any way that it needs to be improved, feel free to submit a
PR.

If this is all greek to you and you want to learn more about web development
with both Sinatra and Rails, check out

I hope this was helpful.

*don't forget to run bundle install*

There is sample content already set up to show you where things go and how to
configure things, but feel free to replace it all when using the skeleton.

The project is preconfigured for testing using rspec. Place your tests in the
spec folder and just run `rake` to to run your tests.
